Problem:
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters 
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Solution:
DP -  DP[i][j] represents the longest common subsequence of text1[0 ... i] & text2[0 ... j].
DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 , if text1[i] == text2[j] DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]) , otherwise.
