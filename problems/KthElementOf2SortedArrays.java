Problem:
Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would 
be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.

Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-th-element-of-two-sorted-array1317/1#

Solution:
Similar to median of 2 sorted arrays.
We have to partition the 2 arrays such that we get:
left = left1 + right1
right = left2 + right2

such that the partition when merged are in sorted order:
(left1+left2) + (right1 + right2)

We can find partitions by making cuts on the arrays using binary search.
Here we make sure that the left portion has k elements exactly, so the kth element will be Math.max(left1, left2)
