/*
Problem:
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

Solution:
The simplest strategy here is to use recursion. Check if p and q nodes are not null, and their values are equal. 
If all checks are OK, do the same for the child nodes recursively.
