Problem:
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Solution:
Binary search:
we know that,
if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1] then there must lie a peek in range of [mid + 1, right]
else in range of [0, mid]
